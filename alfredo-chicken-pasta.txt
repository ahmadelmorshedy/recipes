Ingredients:
=-=-=-=-=-=-
	1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
	  Kosher or coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

	2 tablespoons unsalted butter

	1 teaspoon minced garlic

	4 cups chicken broth, preferably low-sodium

	1 pound penne rigate or ziti pasta (see Recipe Note)

	1 1/2 cups heavy (whipping) cream or half-and-half, warmed


	1 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving

	1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (optional)

Instructions
=-=-=-=-=-=-
	Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Melt 
	the butter in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, 
	in batches if necessary, and sauté until nicely browned on the outside, but 
	still a bit pink inside, about 4 minutes (the pieces don’t have to be browned 
	on all sides; two sides is fine). Remove the chicken and set aside on a plate.

	Do not clean the pan! Those brown bits on the bottom of the pan are going to 
	add flavor to the sauce. Add the garlic to the pan and sauté over medium 
	heat until you can smell it, 30 seconds.

	Turn the heat to high, add the chicken broth, and scrape the bottom of the pan 
	to loosen up all of those delicious caramelized bits. Bring to a simmer, lower 
	to medium heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.

	Add the pasta, stir well, and simmer until the pasta starts to soften, 
	about 8 minutes.

	Stir in the warm cream or half-and-half and the browned chicken with any 
	juices that have accumulated on the plate. Cover and simmer, stirring 
	occasionally, until the pasta is tender, most of the liquid has been absorbed, 
	and the chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes more.

	Stir in the Parmesan until well incorporated, taste, and adjust the seasonings 
	if needed. You can continue with the next step or see the Recipe Notes below 
	for add-in suggestions.

	Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl and sprinkle with the parsley, 
	if desired. Serve hot and pass extra Parmesan at the table.

Recipe Notes
=-=-=-=-=-=-
	Alfredo add-ins: When you add the Parmesan, you can also add any of the 
	following to the pot, alone or in combination: 1 cup slivered sun-dried 
	tomatoes or 1/4 cup sun-dried tomato pesto; 1 tablespoon pureed chipotles 
	in adobo sauce; 4 cups sliced mushrooms, sautéed; 3 cups lightly cooked 
	tiny broccoli florets; 2 tablespoons fresh herbs, such as oregano, thyme, 
	or parsley. Stir over medium heat for another minute or two after these 
	additions. Or you can serve up portions of the basic pasta for those who 
	like it plain and simple, and add proportionate amounts of any of the 
	add-ins to the pot.

	What the kids can do: Measure ingredients, pick add-ins, stir with supervision.

	Make ahead: While it’s certainly reasonable to thrill over a meal of reheated 
	leftover alfredo pasta, either warmed on the stovetop or in the microwave, this 
	dish is best when it’s made just before serving.
